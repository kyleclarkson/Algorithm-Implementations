/**
 *  The Buy-Sell-Days is:
 *      Given a stock's price over an n day period, on what day should an individual buy and sell
 *      stock to maximize revenue (max_rev = sell_price - buy_price)? The individual buys/sells once.
 *
 *      A solution to this problem essentially asks on what day i to buy is the price minimum, and on what day j, such that
 *      i <= j, to sell is the price maximum? If i == j, the revenue is 0. Thus max_rev >= 0.
 *      Note: If max_rev == 0, solution with be {0, 0}
 *
 *  The following includes several algorithms to solve this problem, each with its own runtime.
 *  Some approaches emphasis divide-and-conquer techniques as well as dynamic programming techniques.
