/**
 * The <i>pretty printing</i> problem asks how should a sequence of text
 * be partitioned into a paragraph (lines of text) such that each line contains
 * at most 'L' characters and each line is 'roughly' the same length. This results
 * in each line starting at the same left column, and ending roughly at the
 * same right column.
 * <p>
 * Suppose the text consists of n words. Each word w_i consists of l_i characters
 * (i.e. has length l_i.) First observe that when we partition the text into lines
 * the order of the text must remain the same. This results in O(n^2) partitions of
 * the text.
 * <p>
 * We assume that the text given is punctuated, but does not contain spaces. Thus for each
 * word placed into a line (except the last word of the line) we add a trailing space character.
 * <p>
 * For each partition on a line, if the length of the partition is larger than lineLength, such a
 * partition is infeasible and has cost positive infinite. Otherwise we define the cost of this partition
 * as lineLength - length of partition. Denote this <i>quantity</i> the slack of the partition.
 * <p>
 * Finally we observe this problem has optimal substructure. Suppose the optimal solution has k lines with
 * some cost and the last line contains to partition text[j:n]. Then the optimal cost for the k lines is
 * to partition at index j that minimizes:
 * cost(text[j:n]) + OPT(text[1:j-1]) on k-1 lines.
 * where OPT(i) is the optimal cost of the way to partition the words text[1:i].
